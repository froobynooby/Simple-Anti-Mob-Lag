# section-begin: pathfinder_goals_toggling

# Here you can specify exactly which pathfinder goals should be enabled or disabled for a 'nerfed' mob.
# You can specify per entity type, group or classification:
#   * See here for a lit of entity types: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/entity/EntityType.html
#   * For specifying per group you must prefix with 'group.', e.g. 'group.example_group'.
#   * Entity classifications include: ambient, animal, fish, flying, monster, raider, watermob
# The order is important in these settings, for example: In the below,
#   * Anything in the group 'example_group' would have PathfinderGoalExample disabled.
#   * If they were not in the group 'example_group' but they were a watermob then the goal would *not* be disabled.
#   * If they were neither a watermob or in the group 'example_group' then the goal would be disabled.
PathfinderGoalExample:
  group.example_group: false
  watermob: true
  default: false

# If a pathfinder goal isn't specified here, should it be enabled by default?
unspecified:
  default: true
