# Plugins can add metadata to entities that allows other plugins to identify them with that plugin.
# This option allows you to completely ignore such entities, so that SAML does not interfere with them.
# If SAML interferes with some other plugin's entities, please ask that plugin's developer to add identifying metadata to them.
# We will never freeze (or unfreeze) entities that have metadata on the following list.
ignore-metadata:
  - Elitemob  # This ignores elite mobs from the plugin EliteMobs.
  - infernalMetadata # This ignores infernal mobs from the plugin InfernalMobs.
  - NPC # This ignores NPCs from the plugin Citizens.
  - shopkeeper # This ignores shopkeepers from the plugin Shopkeepers.
#  - Supermob  # This ignores super mobs from the plugin EliteMobs.

# Whenever we freeze a mob we add some data to it that lets us know a few things.
# Should we only unfreeze mobs which have been tagged by the plugin (i.e. mobs we are sure that we have frozen)?
# Keep this option as true if you use another plugin that freezes mobs, or if you summon in mobs with the 'NoAI' tag.
# NOTE: This option is enabled by default in a newly generated config.yml.
# It is disabled by default here because, in the version preceding this, SAML did not add any data to mobs.
# So if you enable this and have any frozen mobs throughout the world then SAML will not unfreeze them unless this option is disabled again.
# This feature only works for version 1.14+.
